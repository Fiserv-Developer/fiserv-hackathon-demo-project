# Fiserv Hackathon Demo Project

This is the Fiserv EMEA Hackathon Demo Project, designed as an example of how to create and submit a project to the hackathon.

A good project readme should contain the following:

Just 'Data & Dash'!

## How to build / run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
